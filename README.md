### What is Bubble sort? 

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping elements if they are in the wrong order.
For example, having an ordered list, we can start sorting it from smallest to largest by checking each element and its neighbor. In the following list, we have 3 as the first element and 1 as the second:

using bubble sort, the first step will be swapping 3 and 1:

As the first two elements have been swapped and sorted, now we look at the second and third index, if the second is bigger than the third, we swap them. In our case, three is bigger than two so we swap the two elements:

finally, the list is now sorted since the other elements are ordered:
